/**
 * The client-side audio manager class.
 * A client must call the instance() method first to create and  
 * initialize the singleton instance. Once a call to instance() has been made,
 * this class is thread-safe.
 *
 * Internally in the class everytime playSfx is called, It creates
 * a thread specifically to play that file to completion.
 * To play music You can build a QQueue of filenames and pass that
 * to playMusic(). playMusic() loops through the queue, Meaning after 
 * finishing a song it puts it in the back of the queue. 
 *
 * The only way to stop a sound from playing is by calling shutdown().
 * After this is called if you wish to play sounds again you 
 * need to call startup();
 *
 * A typical use of the AudioManager class looks like this:
 * @code
 *   QString filename = "fire.ogg";
 *   QQueue musicList = td::AudioManager::instance()->musicDir("sound/music");
 *
 *   //This is the same call as playSfx(filename, sfx);
 *   td::AudioManager::instance()->playSfx(filename);
 *   //If the sound is a notification add ntf to the argument list
 *   td::AudioManager::instance()->playSfx(filename, ntf);
 *
 *   td::AudioManager::instance()->playMusic(musicList);
 *
 *   //call when you wish all sounds to stop
 *   td::AudioManager::instance()->shutdown();
 * @endcode
